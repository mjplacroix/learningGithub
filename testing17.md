# Notes

## 1. Update on the [proposal: "Freeze" EIPs to allow for testing.](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/14#issuecomment-302113189)  [Yoichi/Hudson]

- No call recording available for notes

## 2. Metropolis updates/EIPs
### a. Details and implementations of EIPs.

Martin: Trying to run Hive tests on the clients. Would be really helpful if all clients could gather all individual Metro branches into one main Metro branch. This would help speed up testing. 

### b. Updates to testing.
- more static call tests added

Dimitry: new feature in pro
- blockhash changes (eip96) about to be merge in cpp develop
- documentation in progress

### c. Any "subtleties" we need to work out.
- Need items [submit in comments below].

### d. Review time estimate for testing/release.
- Need items [submit in comments below].
## 3. TRXID opcode: [ethereum/EIPs#222](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/222) [Jan]

Based on how long it would likely take to test, it's not urgent enough to get into Metropolis
- More detailed notes appreciated
